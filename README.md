# serlo.org – Frontend Monorepo

## Notable Packages

- [Frontend](./apps/frontend/README.md) – Next.js app that serves [serlo.org](https://serlo.org).

## Issues and backlog

Technical issues are opened for bugs and feature that we decided to work on. For improvements and backlogs that will take more resources, we have the Feature-Entwicklungsprozess with its Trello-Board. The backlog is tracked there.

This method should avoid stale issues and make it possible to keep an "zero inbox".
